// api need for the code, this is something that i don't really know much about// this is done but did it by hand as it was not as much code as 
i thought to learn other langue



//chosing what langue you are choosing// this is going to be typescrip and html (will try other when remaking the project)




//the path that is needed for the code, room, reading time, number to 100 and more need to ask steve on it// as dad dad about this and got all of 
this done chosie what path as is it in order in the languageInfo file.

// need to do the html so i can see something when it come to testing the page||
    //need to break down the page more and chnage the main languageinfo, thinking of making each page having it ts file with it so if there is a 
    problem it would be easy to know were all of the info would be 


// breaking down section into lesson into 7 section\\ 




// knowing when someone know, that would be ask some room question then number so on so\\




// an adding section of things that are in the section the person on\\




// making a random mode that will have all of the things that you have ALREADY done \\
